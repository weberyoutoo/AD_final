# AD
Assignments of the course "Machine Learning for Anomaly Detection".

# Requirements
The *environment requirements* and *execution commands*  have been written in the `README.md` file in each subfolder separately.

# Final Project
The subfolder `Final` is the final project of this course. It's a challenge from *VAND2.0 Challenge at CVPR with Intel* ([Link](https://www.hackster.io/contests/openvino2024)).
